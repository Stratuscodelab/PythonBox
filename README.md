## Scripts

### Drew's Coffee Shop

**File**: `coffee.py`

**Description**: A fun coffee shop simulation where users can order drinks, interact with a "bouncer," and calculate their total bill. This script demonstrates:
- User input handling
- Conditional logic with `if`/`else` statements
- String manipulation (e.g., `.lower()` for case-insensitive input)
- Basic arithmetic operations for calculating totals

**Features**:
- A "bouncer" that bans certain characters (e.g., Joker, Penguin, Loki) unless they've done enough good deeds.
- A menu of drinks with prices.
- The ability to order multiple items and calculate the total cost.

### Other Scripts

This repository may include other fun and educational scripts, such as:
- **Games**: Simple text-based games like number guessing or rock-paper-scissors.
- **Utilities**: Small tools to perform specific tasks, like a calculator or a to-do list manager.
- **Simulations**: Interactive simulations to learn programming concepts.

Each script will have its own description and instructions in the comments at the top of the file.
